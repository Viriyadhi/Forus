# FORUS
- A community-driven learning place.


#Desciption
The name of the application is "FORUS". A community-driven learning place.  A social media forum that focuses on group chat and has some features like tags, and rank. Moreover, it has a topic-based group chat that is driven by the community.  This application was made to become a solution for the main background problem that our team has chosen. In this application, there is a Group chat that is made to discuss about topic based on what we chose. The property of these groups is public, so everyone can contribute to the group. Inside the group chat, there is a discussion for people with a specific contribution or rank. In the near future, we will develop a conference room for people to discuss with another user about specific topics
